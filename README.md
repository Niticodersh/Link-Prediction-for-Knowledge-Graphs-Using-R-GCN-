# Link Prediction for Knowledge Graphs Using R-GCN

This project implements **Link Prediction** on the **CoDEx dataset** using a **Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN)**. The goal is to predict missing links (tail entities) in a knowledge graph given a head entity and relation. The model leverages **LLM embeddings** for node and relation features, performs link prediction using **margin-based ranking loss**, and is evaluated using **MRR** and **Hits@k** metrics.
